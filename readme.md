# AutomationScript (pending)

AutomationScript (can someone suggest a better name?) is meant to be a series of scripts to automate certain mundane
tasks for me.

## Scripts

`CameraFilesSort.py`

I take photos with my Sony A7 IV and set it save the images in both lossless compressed RAW files (ARW) and compressed
HEIF. However, it is a pain in the ass to sort the files according to their file type. So, after 2 months of procrastination, I have finally decided
to code it during my Lunar New Year holidays :D

Before running the script, please move the files from the SD card into a local folder first. Once the script is
executed, 3 separate folders (i.e., `RAW`,`JPG`,`HIF`) will be created and images with the corresponding type would be
relocated into the folder.

Logs are in the aptly named `logs` folder.
